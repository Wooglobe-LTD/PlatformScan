This   agreement  explains   what   permissions    you    give   to us and    what   our    role   is.    The    full   terms  are    set    out    below, and    you    should read   them   carefully.</p>
    <p>This video owner agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into as of the Date herein with reference to the undersigned’s (“Licensor”) irrevocable grant to WooGlobe Ltd., its successors, affiliates, licensees and assigns (collectively, “WooGlobe”) of the Licensed Rights (defined below) with respect to all or any part of the audiovisual work(s) as further described herein, including without limitation all intellectual property, images, video, identifiable characters and/or individuals, music, sounds, signage, statements, or other trademarks and logos, and all other rights depicted or contained therein (the “Images”).</p>

    <h2 style="color: black;">2. OUR ROLE IN PROVIDING MONETISATION SERVICES</h2>
    <p>This    section    describes  how    we will   use    your   videos to try    and    get    them   used   as widely as possible   and    earn as    much   revenue    as we can    from   the    videos</p>
    <p>We  will   be your   exclusive  manager    for    the promotion, licensing  and    monetisation   of the    videos which  you    ask    us to,    and    we agree  to,    manage for    you    (“Videos”).    Where  you    have   confirmed  to us that   you    wish   to list   your   entire YouTube    channel    with   us,    the    term   “Videos”   as referred   to herein will   refer  to all    videos on your   channel.    You    therefore  grant  us     the    exclusive  worldwide  right  to     perform    the    “Monetisation Services”,  which  means  we can:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            distribute,    publicise, promote,   monetise,  store  and    license    the    Videos,    collectively,  in combination    with   other  videos,    or individually;
        </li>
        <li>sell   and    manage any    and    all    advertising    inventory  sold   alongside  or in relation   to the    Videos,    including  on YouTube    and    similar    platforms;
        </li>
        <li>distribute and    license    the    Videos to others to assist us to promote    the    Videos (this  may include    providing  the    Videos to others,    at our    sole   discretion,    free   of charge to encourage  awareness  of the    Videos);
        </li>
        <li>embed  and    link   to versions   of the    Videos already    available;
        </li>
        <li>display    the    Videos on our    website,   on our    online portal accessible to our    clients,   or on any    other  system used   by us,    and    use    the    Videos in our    own    promotional    activities;
        </li>
        <li>store  the    Videos in our    internal   archive,   including  for    later  use    by us and    our    clients;
        </li>
        <li>
            do anything   connected  with   any    of these  uses   as we see    fit    to enable us to provide    the    Monetisation   Services,  such   as copy   the    Videos,    edit   the    Videos and    communicate    the    Videos to the    public;    and
        </li>
        <li>grant  any    or all    of the    above  rights to third  parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So  we can    perform    the    Monetisation   Services,  you    agree  to complete   any    additional paperwork, or to do anything   else   which  may    be reasonably required   by us to enable us to perform    the    Monetisation   Services,  including, but    not    limited    to,    communicating  with   YouTube    as instructed by us,    clicking   on verification   links  and/or allowing us    to ‘claim’    the    Videos. We will   be entitled   to set    whatever   price  and    terms  for    use    of the    Videos we deem   to be appropriate,   in light  of our    experience and    understanding  of the    market for    the    Videos and     our    clients’   expected   uses   of     the    Videos.    We     will   do     our    best   to     monetise   the    Videos     but    you   acknowledge    that   we cannot guarantee  any    specific   level  of take-up/   or Revenue    (or    any    at all).</p>

    <h2 style="color: black;">3. HOW YOUR VIDEOS MAY BE USED</h2>
    <p><i>This section explains how our partners and clients may use your Videos </i> Our  clients    include     some   of     the   world’s    biggest    websites,  TV and    film   companies, advertisers,   brands,    newspapers and    broadcasters.  Your   Videos could  end    up being  used   by any    of them.  Typical    uses   may    include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>on websites</li>
        <li>in advertising</li>
        <li>as part   of TV shows  or films</li>
        <li>in compilations    of videos</li>
        <li>in news   broadcasts and    as part   of news   stories</li>
        <li>at live   events</li>
        <li>in public places</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Ultimately, once   our    clients    decide to use    a  Video, it is up to them   how    they   use    it so do not    be surprised  to see    your   Videos appearing  in even   the    most   unlikely   of places.    They   may    edit,  alter, adapt, sample,    mash-up    and    otherwise  create new    material   based  on your   Videos.</p>

    <h2 style="color: black;">4. OUR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THE VIDEOS</h2>
    <p>This    section    explains   what   rights you    give   to us and    our    clients    to use    your   Videos and    the    duration   of those  rights.    It also   explains   the    effect of WooGlobe   having worldwide  “exclusive”    rights to your   Videos.
    </p>
    <p>The rights you    grant  to us are    exclusive, which  means  that   you    are    not    able   to do or to allow  anyone else   to do the    things that   you    allow  us to do in this   agreement. You    therefore  warrant    to us that   the    Videos have   not    been   licensed   or sold   to anyone else   in a  way    which  would  conflict   with   the    rights you    grant  to us in this   agreement. You    must   not    engage any    person other  than   us to act    on your   behalf in respect    of the    Videos.    If you     do,    and    you    receive    any    revenue    in     relation   to     the    Videos,    you    must   share  that   with   us     as     split  in    accordance with   section    7  below.</p>
    <p>So  we can    perform    the    Monetisation   Services,  you    grant  us and    our    clients,   licensees  and    partners   (and   their
        clients,   licensees  and     partners) a  worldwide, exclusive,  transferrable license     to     use,   reproduce,     transmit,
        store, publicly   perform,   broadcast, make   available, communicate    to the    public,    display,   exhibit,   distribute,
        index, comment on,    edit,  cut,   modify,    create derivative works  based  upon   and    otherwise  exploit    the    Videos,
        in  whole  or     in     part,  in     and    through    whatever   medium     or     technology     we     (or    our    clients,   licensees  and
        partners)  use    or may    use    in the    future.    We can    grant  this   license    to our    clients,   licensees  and    partners   and
        their  clients,   licensees  and    partners. That license    includes   the    right  for    us to grant  any    duration   of license    to
        our     clients,  licensees  and     partners. The    licenses   we grant   to     our    clients,  licensees  and partners    (and   the
        licences    they  grant   to     their  clients,  licensees  and     partners) may    last   longer  than   the    period    in which  we
        perform    Monetisation   Services   for    you.   They   may,   for    example,   be perpetual  licenses.  </p>

    <p>Any such licenses even after the termination of this agreement shall continue for the benefit of our clients,
        licensees and partners and others who have received the Videos from
        us or our clients, licensees and partners. That    license    applies    to all    media  formats    and    channels   now    known
        or existing   in  the    future     (including    but    not    limited     to    on websites,  in apps,  embedded   in other  media, in
        electronic publications,  video  on demand,    cable, satellite  and    internet   television networks   and    stations,  on
        and    through broadband, mobile and    wireless   platforms, products   and    services,  on physical   and    digital    media,
        and     in     theatrical     release)   for    any    and    all    purposes   including,     but    not    limited    to,    entertainment,     news,
        advertising,   promotion, marketing, publicity, trade  and commercial. You    also   grant  to us the    right  to conduct,
        and    exercise   control    over,  any    proceedings    relating   to your   Videos.    For    the    avoidance  of doubt, however,   we
        are    not    obligated  to issue  proceedings    relating   to the    Videos. You    consent    to any    act    carried    out    by us in
        performing the    Monetisation   Services   and    any    entity or person authorised or licensed   by us which  would
        otherwise  infringe   your   moral  rights anywhere   in the    world  in the    Videos.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: black;">5. YOUR OWNERSHIP AND DELIVERY OF THE VIDEOS</h2>
    <p>This    section    confirms   that   you    own    your   Videos but    asks   that   you    refer  people to us if they   want   to use    your Videos.</p>
    <p>You retain full   rights in and    ownership  of the    Videos,    subject    to the    terms  of this   agreement. You    are    entitled
        to  use    the    Videos     for    your   own    personal,  private    use    and    for    promoting  yourself   and    your   work,  as     an
        example    of the    work   you    have   created.   This   includes   your   own    use    on your   own    YouTube    Channel. You   must
        include    in or alongside  any    Videos you    make   publicly   available  a  sentence   and    link   (which we will   provide    to
        you)    directing  anyone     seeking    to     license    or     use    the    Video  to     our    licensing  portal     or     any    other  internet
        destination    specified  by us. If you    receive    any    enquiries  for    the    commercial licensing, use    or exploitation   of
        the    Videos,    you    must    refer those   enquiries   to    us.    You    must   not    negotiate  any    agreement   following  such
        enquiries  without    our    direct involvement. If    you    wish   us to carry  out    the    Monetisation   Services   in relation   to
        one    or more   of your   videos,    you    should notify us of that   video. We will   notify you    if we agree  to do so.    Only
        if we agree  will   your   video  become subject    to this   agreement. If we ask,   you    must   deliver    to us a  master copy
        of all    Videos (using an online file   transfer   service    we specify).</p>

        advertising    and    intellectual   property   rights.</p>
    <p>Where    the    Videos     contain    material   (e.g.  music,     lyrics,    sound  recordings,    words,     film,  clips,     images     or
        performances)  which  you    do not    own    the    rights to,    you    confirm    and    warrant    to us that   you    have   obtained

        anticipated    by this   agreement. If the    Videos feature    any    identifiable   persons    you    confirm    and    warrant    that
        you    have   obtained   each   applicable permission to  enable you    to grant  the    rights you    are    granting   to us in this
        agreement, and    that   you    shall  provide    all    reasonable assistance in securing   written    proof  of any    of these
        permissions.</p>

    <p>If   you    breach     any    of     these  confirmations  and    warranties,    we     reserve    the    right  to     cease  providing  the   Monetisation   Services   in relation   to the    relevant   Video.</p>
    <p>YOU AGREE  TO INDEMNIFY  US IN FULL   FOR    ALL    LOSSES,    COMPENSATION,  COSTS, EXPENSES   AND    FINANCIAL
        PAYOUTS    INCURRED   OR SUFFERED   BY US AS A  RESULT OF YOUR   BREACH OF THESE  CONFIRMATIONS  AND
        WARRANTIES AND/OR ANY    OF THE    TERMS  OF THIS   AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p>If  we suffer any    losses or incur  any    liabilities    (for   example,   we are    required   to pay    compensation   or to pay,
        or we incur, legal  or other  costs  and    expenses)  as a  result of your   breach of the    above  confirmations  and
        warranties,    we may    deduct them   from   any    amounts    otherwise  payable    by us to you    under  this   agreement,
        and    may    otherwise  require    you    to reimburse  us for    those  losses and    liabilities.</p>

    <h2 style="color: black;">7. OUR PAYMENTS TO YOU</h2>
    <p>In full consideration of all of the Licensed Rights granted hereunder, WooGlobe will pay Licensor the Share
        of the net revenue earned and received by WooGlobe from the exhibition, distribution, broadcast, licensing
        and other exploitation of the Licensed Rights, less proceeds received from uses intended to generate
        marketable interest in the Images. Licensor shall be responsible for any taxes relating to payments it receives
        to the appropriate tax authority and governmental entities. Licensor must deliver to WooGlobe agreement to
        these terms, any additional information requested by WooGlobe relating to the Images, and the abovedescribed
        images in a format acceptable to WooGlobe in order to receive payment. WooGlobe shall pay the
        royalty to Licensor after every quarter end on the fifteenth (15) day (i.e 15th April, 15th July, 15th Oct, 15th
        Jan); however, if the amount owed to Licensor is less than hundred US dollars ($100 USD) in the three
        months period, WooGlobe reserves the right to carry the royalty over for payment to Licensor until the amount
        exceeds hundred US dollars ($100 USD). If the amount never exceeds that amount then no payment will
        come due. Licensee will have no obligation to pay any royalties which are reasonably suspected by Licensee, in its sole discretion, to have resulted from fraudulent, misleading or false activities by Licensor. Licensor
        may choose to be paid via PayPal or electronic bank transfer. The payment transfers fees will be deducted
        from the total royalty payment due. Licensor further understands that the Licensee is not responsible for any unclaimed payments.</p>
    <p>This    section    describes  how    we calculate  what   earnings   you    make   from   your   Videos and    how    we will   pay
        them   to you.   </p>
    <p>In this section 7, the following words shall have the following meanings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            “Revenue” shall mean all revenues, income, payments, advances, fees, royalties and other   financial benefits arising from the use of the Videos through the
            Monetisation Services but not from Promotional Use.
        </li>
        <li>
            “Promotional Use” shall mean the use of the Videos in any WooGlobe promotional activities as determined in our absolute discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
            “Specific Sale” shall mean single or related sales of the Videos where such sales involve an i
            ndividual, a per client, or a per Video rate (by way of non    -
            exhaustive example, where a client pays a single fee for use of your Video).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We  shall  be exclusively    entitled   to collect    any    and    all    revenues,  income,    payments,  advances,  fees,  royalties
        and    other  financial  benefits   arising    from   the    use    of the    Videos carried    out    through    the    Monetisation   Services.</p>
    <p>We  shall  pay    to you,   once   a  quarter    on the fifteenth (15) day (i.e 15th April, 15th July, 15th Oct, 15th Jan);
        the    agreed percentage of any    Revenue    collected  by us and    attributed by us to the    Videos,    in our    absolute
        discretion,     for    the    use    of     the    Videos     on     YouTube    and/or     on     any    other  platform   but    excluding  Revenue
        collected  from   WooGlobe’s sales  of advertising    against    your   Videos and    after  deduction  of any    applicable
        taxes  or duties and    bank   or PayPal fees.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the    foregoing, your   share  of any    Revenue    collected  by us from   Specific   Sales  shall  be the
        agreed percentage of any    Revenue    collected  by us.     We    are    not    obliged    to pay    you    any    share  of Revenue
        arising    from   any    Promotional    Use    of the    Videos.</p>
    <p>It  is a  requirement    of this   agreement  that   you    have   and    maintain   an active PayPal account    in your   name.  We
        can    and    will   only   pay    your   Revenue    share  to the    PayPal account    in your   name   you    provide    to us when   you
        submit your   Videos to us.    If you    provide    us with   the    wrong  PayPal account    details    (for   example    if there  is a
        mistake    in the    account    details    you    provide)   or if those  details    become inaccurate (for   example    if your   PayPal
        account    closes),   we will   not    be able    to    pay    you    and,    subject    to     the   next   paragraph, we will   be under  no
        obligation to do so.    We will   be under  no obligation to repay  any    monies we have   paid   out    to any    incorrect
        PayPal account    details    you    provided   to us.</p>
    <p>If  we discover   a  problem    with   a  PayPal account,   we will   notify you    and    give   you    30 days   to respond    to fix    the
        problem.   If we hear   from   you    within those  30 days   with   working    PayPal account    details    in your   name,  we
        will   pay    you    any    outstanding    monies and    continue   to pay    your   new    account.   However,   if you    do not    respond
        within the    30 days   we will   be under  no obligation to pay    you    any    of the    outstanding    Revenue    share  or any
        further    Revenue    share. After  those  30 days,  if you    provide    working    PayPal account    details    we will   pay    you
        any    Revenue    share  earned after  you    provide    the    working    details    but    not    any    Revenue    share  earned before
        then.</p>
    <p>
        You    agree   that   the    part   of     the    Revenue    that  we  do     not    pay    to     you    represents     our    fee    (commission)   for
        carrying   out    the    Monetisation   Services.  You    also   understand that   if we do not    collect    any    sums   due    to us (for
        example    due    to non-payment    or insolvency of the    relevant   platform   or where  we do not    receive    sufficient
        reporting  from   a  platform   so as to enable us to adequately assign revenue)   that   we will   not    owe    you    any
        share  of that   sum    (but   we will   pay    your   share  to you    if it is collected  or resolved   in the    future).
    </p>
    <p>The  above  provisions     will   also   apply  to     any    Revenue    collected  by     us     after  we     have   ceased     providing
        Monetisation   Services   but    arising    under  arrangements   concluded, or from   uses   licensed,  prior  to the    date   of
        termination    of this   agreement  (unless    we terminate  it because    you    are    in breach of it).</p>
    <p>We   shall  be     entitled   to     deduct     a  reasonable     sum    from   any    Revenue    where  we     incur  costs  in     pursuing
        unauthorised   use    of your   Videos.    For    the    avoidance  of doubt, any    such   deductions shall  be limited to what
        is reasonable to cover  our    costs  and    you    shall  never  incur  any    liability  – instead  we will   deduct the    reasonable
        costs  prior  to our    calculation    of your   Revenue    share.
    </p>
    <p>If  the    amounts    payable    to you    at any    time   are    less   than   $100 USD we    will   hold   such   sums   on your   behalf
        until  the    monthly    payment    date   on which  amounts    due    to you    are    $100   USD    or more   in aggregate. Where
        your   Revenue    share  for    any    12 month  period does   not    exceed $100   USD,   we may    apply  that   Revenue    share
        as an administrative fee    against    our    maintaining    your   account.</p>
    <p>You accept that   you    are    responsible    for    all    taxes  payable    by you    as a  result of receiving  any    amounts    payable
        to you.   You    also   accept that   we may    be obliged    by our    local  taxation   authorities    to make   a  deduction  or
        withholding    from   any    amounts    payable    to you.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:black;">8. DURATION AND TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p>This    section    explains   the    duration   of agreement  and    how    you    and/or we can    terminate. </p>
    <p>The duration of the license is perpetual. You may seek to terminate this Agreement with at least thirty (30)
        days’ written notice, after one year of signing this agreement; however, this Agreement shall only be
        terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in
        WooGlobe’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by WooGlobe prior
        to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>We  may    terminate  this   agreement  immediately    if you    are    in breach of any    of its    terms.
        On  termination    of     this   agreement,     we     will   cease  actively   to     perform    the    Monetisation   Services   but,   as
        explained  in section    4, the    licenses   we have   granted    may    remain in force  (depending on the    length of licenses
        we have   previously granted).  We will   not,   therefore, be required   to request    that   our    clients,   licensees  and
        partners   and    others who    have   received   the    Videos from   us or our    clients,   licensees  and    partners   cease  their
        use    of the    Videos,    and    you    acknowledge    that   the    Videos may    remain in use    by these  people,    potentially    in
        perpetuity (including by being  available  on the    Internet   or included   in broadcasts),   and    that   such   use    will   not
        be a  breach by us and/or our    clients    of any    of your   rights.</p>
    <h2 style="color:black;">9. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE RECEIVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT A VIDEO</h2>
    <p>This    section    explains   what   we can    do if someone    complains  about  your   Videos.</p>
    <p>If  anyone complains  to us,    starts any    legal  action against    us,    or makes  a  claim  against    us in relation   to a  Video
        we shall  have   the    absolute   right  to act    how    we wish   in response   and    you    must   provide    us with   all    assistance
        and    take   such   steps  as we reasonably require    to assist with   such   a  response.  We may,   for    example,   cease  to
        perform     the   Monetisation    Services   and    request    that   our    clients    stop   using the     Video.     You   may     need   to
        answer various    questions  about  the    Video  and    enable us to speak  to individuals    featured   in the    Video.</p>
    <p>If  we suffer any    losses or incur  any    liabilities    (for   example,   we are    required   to pay    compensation   or to pay,
        or we incur, legal  or other  costs  and    expenses)  as a   result    of such   a  complaint, legal  action or claim, we
        reserve    the    right  to,    in addition   to all    other  rights to pursue such   losses or liabilities,   deduct them   from   any
        amounts    otherwise  payable    by us to you    under  this   agreement.</p>
    <h2 style="color:black;">10. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
    <p>You  understand     and    acknowledge    that   WooGlobe   makes  information    available  to     you    and    all    such
        information    and    communication  shall  be deemed to be “Confidential  Information”.  For    the    purposes   of this
        agreement   “Confidential  Information”   includes,  but    is     not    limited    to:    all    information    about WooGlobe’s
        organisation,  affairs,   plans, technology,    proposals, the    Monetisation   Service,   Revenue,   any    communication
        about  your    Revenue,  any     fees   or     commissions,  any    information    about   sales  of    your   Videos  or    any     other
        information    which  either you    or we ought  reasonably regard as confidential   or which  is marked confidential.
        You     understand     that   this   agreement  creates    a  relationship   of     confidence     and    trust  between    you    and
        WooGlobe   with   respect    to Confidential   Information.</p>
    <h2 style="color: black;">11. OUR LIABILITY</h2>
    <p>Nothing in this   agreement  shall  limit  or exclude    our    liability  to you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>for death or personal injury caused by our negligence;</li>
        <li>for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or</li>
        <li>for any other liability that may not, by law, be limited or excluded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subject to this,  in no event  shall  we be liable to you    for    any    losses and    any    liability  we do have   for    losses you
        suffer that   arise  out    of or in connection with   this   agreement  shall  not    exceed the    total  of all    amounts    payable
        or paid   by us to you    under  this   agreement  at the    date   of the    relevant   claim  or,    if greater,   $500 USD.  Losses
        are    foreseeable    where  they   could  be contemplated   by you    and    us at the    time   you    accept these  terms.
    </p>
    <p>We   will   not    be     liable     or     responsible    for    any    failure    to     perform,   or     delay  in     performance    of,    any    of     our
        obligations    under  this   agreement  that   is caused by events outside    our    reasonable control.</p>
    <h2 style="color:black;">12. GENERAL</h2>
    <p>You may    not    transfer   or assign any    or all    of your   rights or obligations    under  this   agreement.
        All    notices    given  by you to us must   be given  in writing    to the    address    set    out    at the    start  of this   agreement.
        We may    give   notice to you    at either the    email  or postal address    you    provide    to us in the    form   you    complete
        and    return to us.</p>
